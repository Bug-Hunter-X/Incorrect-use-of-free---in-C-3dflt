This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: attempting to free memory that wasn't dynamically allocated.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` offers a corrected version. This incorrect usage can lead to program crashes or unpredictable behavior.  The solution focuses on only freeing memory allocated with functions like malloc, calloc or realloc.
